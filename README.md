## ATTENTION!

On some systems the `Creature Type` and `Custom Creature Type` options might cause Splatter to not work correctly, simply go into the module settings for Splatter and empty both those settings leaving them blank.

## NOTICE: FEATURE REQUESTS

I know that this implementation doesen't have all the features BnG had BUT i feel like it has enough customization for most people. Because the point of this module is to keep it streamlined to avoid making it impossible to mantain no feature requests will be implemented. Unless is something that all the users of this module would greatly benfit from, please refrain from asking. Thanks for your understanding :)

## FAQ

**Blood and guts exists, why make a new one?:** Blood and guts was a massive project and while it was amazing, with a lot of code comes a lot of issues and it's extremely difficult to mantain and fix. This implementation is simpler and more streamlined, and while it has less features, it will be much easier to mantain and adopt if it ever gets abandoned
